## Teams listening via Azure Communication Services (ACS) with 30-sec Whisper transcription

### What youâ€™ll build

#### A small two-part app:
- Client (browser) â€” joins a Microsoft Teams meeting as an ACS user using the ACS Calling SDK and accesses raw incoming audio (mixed and/or up to several dominant speakers, per SDK capabilities).
- Backend (Node/Fastify) â€” receives audio frames from the client, buffers into 30-second chunks, normalizes to 16 kHz mono PCM, and runs Whisper (e.g., whisper.cpp) to produce text; optionally forwards each chunkâ€™s transcript to your downstream system.

#### How To
ðŸ§­ ACS join is supported with meeting link / meeting ID+passcode. The meeting tenant must allow anonymous/external join and admit you from the lobby if configured. Raw media access is previewâ€”great for POCs, test thoroughly before production. 

#### Architecture (high level)
- Browser: CallClient â†’ CallAgent.join(locator) â†’ subscribe to raw incoming audio stream(s) â†’ send PCM frames to backend over WebSocket. 

- Backend: per-call buffer â†’ 30s window â†’ write WAV (16 kHz, mono, PCM16) â†’ run Whisper â†’ emit JSON { text, startMs, endMs } (and push to your endpoint if needed).
- Policies: success depends on organizerâ€™s tenant settings (anonymous join allowed; ACS not blocked). Raw media access is preview; mixed stream may reflect top ~4 dominant speakers depending on platform/SDK. 

#### Prerequisites
- Azure subscription (to create an ACS resource).
- ACS resource & connection string.
- Node 18+ (for backend & token server).
- A Teams meeting link / meeting ID+passcode that allows anonymous/external join (organizer lobby policies still apply). 

#### Whisper transcription engine:
Easiest local path: whisper.cpp CLI (CPU/GPU). 
GitHub
If you later want post-meeting Graph transcripts instead of live audio, that requires the organizerâ€™s tenant to grant app/RSC permissions; ACS join alone doesnâ€™t grant transcript API access.
